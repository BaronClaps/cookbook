# [`NullPointerException`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/NullPointerException.html) on initialization

NullPointerExceptions are common errors that occur when code runs in the wrong order. Here, we will cover how and why NPEs happen in general, as well as some common FTC-specific issues.

## Ingredients

1. A limited knowledge of Java.
2. A desire to learn, debug, or solve problems!

## The Recipe

### What does it look like?
The general format of the error is:
```
java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to invoke [...] on a null object reference
```

On the Driver Station, you may see a stacktrace similar to this:

![A stacktrace of the Driver Station with a NPE.](./npe_exception.jpg)
<div style="text-align: center;"><em>A stacktrace of the Driver Station with a NPE.</em></div>

### Why does this happen?
First, we need to understand more about how Java works a little more in depth.
> This section is a little lengthy, feel free to scroll below for the solution.

When we program in Java, we have expressions, which have a certain **type**.
The type tells us about the properties of said expression.

This lets us add `int`s, set the power of a `DcMotor`, or check if a `boolean` is true!

Type systems also give us a degree of validity; we can't add servos to booleans.

> The following is a very generalized description with oversights, but is sufficient for conceptual understanding.

In Java, there are two categories of types:
  - Primitive Types
    - Primitives are not objects, and do not have methods, only a value.
    - Primitives are passed by value.
    - `int`, `double`, and `boolean`, are examples of primitives.
  - Reference Types
    - All types that extend `Object` are passed by reference, and hence, reference types.
    - All objects are passed by reference.
    - `class`es, `interface`s, `enum`s, arrays

> 
> **Storing by Value:**
> - You are storing the actual value of the variable in memory. 
> - This means that when you assign one variable to another, a copy of the value is made. 
> - Changes to one variable do not affect the other.

>   int jeffMoney = bobMoney; // "jeffMoney" gets the value of "bobMoney", not a reference to "bobMoney"
>   
>   jeffMoney = 10; // changing "jeffMoney" does not affect "bobMoney"
>   
>   System.out.println(bobMoney); // 20
>   ```
> **Storing by Reference:**
> - You are storing a reference or memory address to the location where the actual data is stored.
> - This means that when you assign one variable to another, they both point to the same memory location.
> - Changes to one variable will affect the other because they both refer to the same data.
> - ```java
>   Person bob = new Person("bob", 18);
>   Person anon = bob; // "anon" now refers to the same object as "bob"
>   
>   System.out.println(bob.getAge()); // will print 18
>
>   anon.setAge(21); // changing "anon" also changes "bob"
>   
>   System.out.println(bob.getAge()); // will print 21
>   ```

`null` really refers to a null **reference**. This means any `Object` can have a `null` value. 

Any uninitialized `Object` has no reference to point to; a null reference, or `null`.
NPEs occur when you try to use the typed properties of an object while it points to nothing. 
This is so no undefined behavior occurs. 

Java does not provide any means of "null-safety", and so it is the responsibility of the programmer to check for and handle potential null values.

FTC specific examples include trying to access the `hardwareMap` at instantiation, or just never assigning a value to a `HardwareDevice`.

### hardwareMap and telemetry

It is important to note that NPEs are a very common, generic exception. However, the most common causes in FTC are due to the way `hardwareMap` and `telemetry`  work. This section will detail the way that `hardwareMap` and `telemetry` work, why it's so easy to get them wrong, and how to fix it.

Whenever you write an `OpMode`, you use the `telemetry` and `hardwareMap` objects all the time! 

```java
// Instantiate drive motors
DcMotor frontLeft = hardwareMap.get(DcMotor.class, "frontLeft");
```
*A generic example of using `hardwareMap`.*

However, these objects have to come from somewhere, and in fact they do! They are both created within the `OpMode` itself. This means that **you cannot directly access `hardwareMap` OR `telemetry` from outside an OpMode.** This is a very common issue, and typically the biggest cause of NullPointerExceptions.

There is actually even another layer to this - while `telemetry` can be accessed anywhere within the `OpMode`, `hardwareMap` must only be accessed after the `OpMode` has started running.

*Technical details: `hardwareMap` and `telemetry` are both from `OpModeInternal` (which both `OpMode` and `LinearOpMode` inherit). `telemetry` is instantiated on class construction, whereas `hardwareMap` is instantiated as soon as the `OpMode` is run.*

### Common Issues: Hardware Devices in OpModes

Hardware devices (anything that requires `hardwareMap`) are **NOT** accessible at class instantiation; that is, one **cannot** do the following:

```java   
@TeleOp
public class Testing extends OpMode {
  private DcMotor motor = hardwareMap.get(DcMotor.class, "motor"); // this will cause a NullPointerException because hardwareMap isn't defined until init()!

  @Override
  public void init() { } // it's always a red flag if the init is empty! TH=

  @Override
  public void loop() { 
    motor.setPower(1.0); 
  }
}
```

Hardware devices only start to become accessible during and after `init()` in `OpMode`s and within `runOpMode()` in `LinearOpMode`s.
Therefore, if you're using an `OpMode`, you should be instantiating (creating) your hardware devices in `init()`. In a `LinearOpMode`, hardware devices should be instatiated in `runOpMode()`, and before `waitForStart()`.

```java
@TeleOp
public class Testing extends OpMode {
  private DcMotor motor;

  @Override
  public void init() {
    motor = hardwareMap.get(DcMotor.class, "motor"); // hardwareMap is defined here, so this won't cause an error!
    // any other hardware device instantiations should also go here
  }

  @Override
  public void loop() {
    motor.setPower(1.0); 
  }
}
```

### Common Issues: Hardware Devices in External Classes

Let's say you have a separate class where you want to access either `hardwareMap` or `telemetry`, or both. For example, we might have an `Arm` class that controls a simple rotating arm.

```java
public class Arm {
  private DcMotor armMotor;

  /**
   * Tilts the arm using raw motor power.
   * @param power The motor power.
   */
  public void tilt(double power) {
    armMotor.setPower(power);
  }
}
```

Now, you might notice in the above code that the value of `armMotor` is never set to anything. This will cause a `NullPointerException`! To prevent this, we need to assign `armMotor` a value. Typically, we'd do this using `hardwareMap`. However, if you recall, `hardwareMap` isn't defined outside of `OpMode`s! So, what to do? Well, the idea is actually rather simple: when creating an `Arm`, we'll ask for an instance of `hardwareMap` that we can then use to define `armMotor`. Since `Arm` is created in an `OpMode`, `hardwareMap` will be defined!

```java
public class Arm {
  private DcMotor armMotor;

  /**
   * @param hardwareMap The hardwareMap instance from an OpMode.
   */ 
  public Arm(HardwareMap hardwareMap) {
    armMotor = hardwareMap.get(DcMotor.class, "armMotor");
  }

  /**
   * Tilts the arm using raw motor power.
   * @param power The motor power.
   */
  public void tilt(double power) {
    armMotor.setPower(power);
  }
}
```

Now that we have our `Arm` class, this is what an `OpMode` would look like:

```java
@TeleOp
public class ArmTest extends OpMode {
  private Arm arm;

  @Override
  public void init() {
    arm = new Arm(hardwareMap); // we still need to instantiate the arm in init(), since hardwareMap isn't defined before then
  }

  @Override
  public void loop() {
    arm.tilt(gamepad1.right_trigger - gamepad1.left_trigger); // use triggers to move arm up and down
  }
}
```

We can also do the same thing for `telemetry`:

```java
private Telemetry telemetry;

public Arm(HardwareMap hardwareMap, Telemetry opModeTelemetry) {
  armMotor = hardwareMap.get(DcMotor.class, "armMotor");
  telemetry = opModeTelemetry;
}
```

...and we now have an `Arm` class that can access both `hardwareMap` and `telemetry`!

### Common Issues: BlocksCompanion hardwareMap and telemetry

Remember when we mentioned how `hardwareMap` and `telemetry` aren't defined outside of an `OpMode`? While this is true, there is still a way you can make your code *think* it can access `hardwareMap` and `telemetry`. Doing this will cause all of the NullPointerException problems with none of the helpful red squiggly lines.

```java
package org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode;

import static org.firstinspires.ftc.robotcore.external.BlocksOpModeCompanion.hardwareMap;
import static org.firstinspires.ftc.robotcore.external.BlocksOpModeCompanion.telemetry;

import com.qualcomm.robotcore.hardware.DcMotor;

public class Arm {
  private DcMotor armMotor;

  public Arm() {
    armMotor = hardwareMap.get(DcMotor.class, "armMotor");
  }

  /**
   * Tilts the arm using raw motor power.
   * @param power The motor power.
   */
  public void tilt(double power) {
    armMotor.setPower(power);
    telemetry.addData("Arm tilt power", power); // log tilt power in telemetry
  }
}
```

What's wrong here? You might notice how our constructor for `Arm` no longer has a parameter for `hardwareMap`, yet we can still use `hardwareMap` somehow! Similarly, we are also using `telemetry` without ever even defining it! This bug is incredibly sneaky. Normally, we don't pay a ton of attention to imports, but here the imports are exactly what matter. Let's isolate the important imports:

```java
import static org.firstinspires.ftc.robotcore.external.BlocksOpModeCompanion.hardwareMap;
import static org.firstinspires.ftc.robotcore.external.BlocksOpModeCompanion.telemetry;
```

These two imports are incredibly nasty. The `hardwareMap` and `telemetry` above are not actually meant for us, but actually for Blocks users! This is, behind the scenes, what Blocks OpModes use. Since we are not using Blocks, these imports don't work. Luckily, although the bug is nasty, the solution is rather simple - get rid of the imports and pass `hardwareMap` and `telemetry` in like we did in the previous section!
